# Autonomous-Vehicle-Safety-Analysis
This project explores failures and disengagements in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) being tested on public roads in California. The dataset you will be using however, while derived from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database, has been sufficiently altered to be manageable for this project. As such, the results of the analysis you perform will not directly represent the California study. The analysis will use statistical and probabilistic approaches to evaluate how well the AI-driven decision and control of AVs works under a variety of conditions and developing insights into why/how they disengage. Later, a Naive Bayes model was developed to predict the cause of disengagement based on the features: location, weather and type of trigger.

Concept learned and applied
1. Handling datasets (Importing, extracting and summarizing features)
2. Basic statistical analysis of the dataset
3. Probabilistic Analysis of the data using concepts from ECE 313 (e.g., Probability,
Conditional Probability, Bayes formula)
4. Create a Naive Bayes model to classify data based on features (e.g., weather
conditions) in the dataset

This project did not used any python libraries. Instead, the Naive Bayes model was developed based on the calculation of conditional probabilty tables and prior probability table.
